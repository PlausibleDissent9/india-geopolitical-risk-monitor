# Notes for the author — changes needing your words

Per the build manual I don't write methodology prose. Two things surfaced
during the build that section 3 should state; suggested language below,
edit as you see fit, then delete this file.

## 1. Sum-of-group-shares construction (methodology §3)

GDELT's DOC API rejects queries longer than ~250 characters (measured
2026-07-24: 222 accepted, 271 rejected). Channels whose full term set
exceeds the budget are partitioned into sub-queries (currently
pakistan_west and gulf_energy, two groups each) and the channel's raw
series is the **sum of the group shares**. Where two groups match the
same article, that article counts twice, so the sum is a slight upper
bound on the true union share. Suggested §3 sentence:

> Where a channel's term set exceeds the API's query-length limit, the
> channel series is the sum of two sub-query shares; an article matching
> both sub-queries counts twice, making the series a slight upper bound
> on the union share. The partition is fixed and versioned with the
> dictionaries.

## 2. Layer-4b/4d fetch window (methodology §8)

The robustness and placebo harnesses fetch 2022-onward only (request
budget), while the primary series extends to 2017. The §8 numbers should
say which window each check covers.

## 3. Validation numbers (methodology §8)

After `python -m src.validate hit-rate|placebo|robustness` you'll have
`docs/data/validation.json`. §8's hit-rate table, placebo overlap, and
robustness correlations are yours to transcribe and interpret — a missed
episode explained honestly is a finding, not a failure.
