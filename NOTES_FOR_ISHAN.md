## 0. Delegated fills to review

At your instruction, the Wikipedia article lists, alternative composite
weights, Trends search terms, and the pre-2022 validation episodes were
filled for you (2026-07-24). All Wikipedia titles were verified against
the pageviews API; the weights are round-number judgment calls with their
logic in `alt_weights.json`'s `_meta`. Skim them once — they are the kind
of thing an interviewer asks about.

## 0.1 Circularity audit of the delegated fills (2026-07-24, post-review)

A review caught a real violation: **"Galwan River"** was in the
china_east Wikipedia list while the Galwan Valley clash is a validation
episode. The page's pageviews are near-zero before June 2020, so the
Wikipedia series would have detected that episode by construction — and
*Galwan* is on the banned list the CI test enforces; the test just did
not cover the Wikipedia file. Fixed: article removed, wiki_volume.csv
rebuilt without it, and the ex-ante CI test now covers
`wikipedia_articles.json` and `trends_terms.json` too.

The rest of the audit, applying the operative principle (a query-list
entry must have meaningful attention baseline independent of any
validation episode):

- **Houthi movement** (shipping) — KEPT. Standing actor page with years
  of pre-2023 baseline (Yemen war since 2014); unlike Galwan River, the
  page does not exist because of the validation events.
- **OPEC** (gulf) vs the "OPEC+ collapse" episode — KEPT. Decades of
  baseline; the episode is named after the institution, not vice versa.
- **Iran–Israel relations** (gulf) vs the four Iran/Israel episodes —
  KEPT. Standing bilateral page, long baseline.
- **Suez Canal** (shipping dictionary and wiki) vs the Ever Given
  episode — KEPT. Permanent chokepoint baseline.
- **"Tawang"** (GDELT dictionary) vs the 2022 Tawang-clash episode —
  KEPT but worth one honest sentence in your §8: the town has standing
  dispute coverage predating the clash, but the shared name makes that
  one episode easier to detect than a name-free case would be.
- **"eastern Ladakh"** (GDELT dictionary) — KEPT, same one-sentence
  treatment: it is sector vocabulary, not an event name, but its heavy
  press usage dates from the 2020 standoff.
- **"ladakh standoff"** (Trends) — SWAPPED for "india china standoff":
  the 2020 event is commonly *called* the Ladakh standoff, which is too
  close to an event name for a query list.
- **alt_weights.json**, **pre-2022 episode appends** — no circularity
  surface (weights touch no queries; episode names never enter any
  query list, and the banned list covers them).

Per the build manual I don't write methodology prose. Two things surfaced
during the build that section 3 should state; suggested language below,
edit as you see fit, then delete this file.

## 1. Sum-of-group-shares construction (methodology §3)

GDELT's DOC API rejects queries longer than ~250 characters (measured
2026-07-24: 222 accepted, 271 rejected). Channels whose full term set
exceeds the budget are partitioned into sub-queries (currently
pakistan_west and gulf_energy, two groups each) and the channel's raw
series is the **sum of the group shares**. Where two groups match the
same article, that article counts twice, so the sum is a slight upper
bound on the true union share. Suggested §3 sentence:

> Where a channel's term set exceeds the API's query-length limit, the
> channel series is the sum of two sub-query shares; an article matching
> both sub-queries counts twice, making the series a slight upper bound
> on the union share. The partition is fixed and versioned with the
> dictionaries.

## 2. Layer-4b/4d fetch window (methodology §8)

The robustness and placebo harnesses fetch 2022-onward only (request
budget), while the primary series extends to 2017. The §8 numbers should
say which window each check covers.

## 3. Validation numbers (methodology §8)

After `python -m src.validate hit-rate|placebo|robustness` you'll have
`docs/data/validation.json`. §8's hit-rate table, placebo overlap, and
robustness correlations are yours to transcribe and interpret — a missed
episode explained honestly is a finding, not a failure.
